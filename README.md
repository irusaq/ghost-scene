## Spooky Ghost and Graveyard Scene ðŸŽƒðŸ‘»

We created a spooky ghost and graveyard scene because we wanted to experiment with transparent materials, lighting, and spooky animations.

Key features of our scene include:

- **Two animated flying ghosts** that glide in circular patterns and move rhythmically up and down  
- **Keyboard interactivity:**
  - `0` â€” Toggle ghost animation  
  - `1` â€” Toggle the first row of graves  
  - `2` â€” Toggle the second row of graves  
  - `3` â€” Toggle the third row of graves  
  - `4` â€” Toggle the fourth row of graves  
  - `S` â€” Play a spooky sound effect  
- **Glowing candles** with orange flames and point lights that cast shadows  
- **Fences** made of repeating pickets and a top rail enclosing the graveyard  
- **Textured gravestones** with curved tops and R.I.P. inscriptions  
- **Fog and directional lighting** to create atmosphere and depth
